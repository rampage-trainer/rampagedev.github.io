(With this release all .ini support got dropped and all .ini related stuff has been replaced
with either an .xml or an .json file. Due to that rampage has a new xml based object saver and older .ini files
will no longer work with version 1.5.2.
This means that if you want to keep your existing files you need to get the new Settings.json and the Hotkeys.json)
Also the XML folder in the spooner folder got removed all map files can now just be placed inside the spooner folder.
